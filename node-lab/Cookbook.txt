Core modules:
- OS
- FS - FileSystem
- Events
- HTTP


- We export functions, variables etc from module using module.exports

---- Module wrapper function -----
In node, whatever we write in a module it automatically get enwrapped in a
self invoked function that has some special arguments like require, exports,
module, __filename, __dirname

---------- For express --------
npm init ---yes for initializing package.json file
npm i express

- Nodemon, module to restart server on code changes
run app with following cmd
- nodemon index.js

-----------------------------
. Express Middleware or Middle ware function: 
    function that takes a request and either pass a response or pass it to another middleware function
    e.g. `app.use(express.json());` to read req body to json and we are doing it at the start of request processing pipeline
        similarly `(req, res)=>{}` in route handler is also a example of middleware function
    
    We can build our own middlwares as well, which we usually do for logging, authentication etc

    There are some cool 3rd party middlewares as well, e.g. Morgan - to log all incoming requests, helmet for security etc


-------------
- rc package is popular for managing configuration but there is 1 package i.e. `config` which is a little more cleaner.
- `debug` package for debugging.

----- Popular templating engines with express ------
- Pug
