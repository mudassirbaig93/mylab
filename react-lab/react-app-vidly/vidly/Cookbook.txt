Component Lifecycle hooks: - Important to know when writing apps

Life cycle hooks = special methods that we can create and react will automatically call them.


Phase 1 - Mounting
Phase 2 - Update
Phase 3 - Delete

* Mounting = Element created and inserted into the DOM.
    Available Lifecycle Hooks(by order) = 
                1. constructor
                2. render
                3. componentDidMount


* Update = Whenever state is changed
     Available Lifecycle Hooks(by order) = 
                1. render
                2. componentDidUpdate

* Unmount/Delete = Component Delete
      Available Lifecycle Hooks(by order) = 
                1. componentWillUnmount
