- create-react-app counter-app
- npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
- import bootstrap in index.js
 
- created component folder in src, and a counter.jspx there
! we have installed 'Simple React Extension' that gives us shortcut to import react components i.e. imrc, and generate class component i.e. cc

- import new Counter component instead of App in index.js and retrun Counter in ReactDOM.render
- We keep state elements in components that usually contains the data to show, and React tries to sync it between Virtual DOM and actual DOM
